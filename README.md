#Epic Software Sale Web App - WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT PRODUCTION READY

This is part of a product suite that allows you to build a full featured 
e-commerce system and to self host it. The platform includes an API, Web App, iOS and Android native apps.
All open source, all 100% free. [Contact us](mailto:justin@epic-software.co.uk) if you want bespoke hosting solutions.

## Installation

Follow these simple instructions to get up and running:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/justin-nodeboy/epic-software-pos-web.git
```
Once the project has been cloned, `cd` into the directory and run the following
```bash
$ npm install
```
Finally to run the app, just do
```bash
$ npm start
```
You will need to have the API running in order to use the web app, although it will fall over gracefully if there is no connection
